    Icons are used to visually communicate core parts of the product and available actions. They can act as
    wayfinding tools to help merchants more easily understand where they are in the product, and common interaction
    patterns that are available.

> **Warning:** We are removing **Monotone & Twotone** suffix from most of the icons to keep it synced with Shopifyâ€™s Polaris Component library.
  For example: Currently we have the icon name **AbandonedCartMajorMonotone/AbandonedCartMajorTwotone**, this icon name will be renamed as **AbandonedCartMajor**.
